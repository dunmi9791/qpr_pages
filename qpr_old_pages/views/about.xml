                                                        economies, particularly in
                                                        developing countries like Nigeria. SMEs account for the majority of businesses
                                                        worldwide and are important contributors
                                                        to job creation and global economic development. They represent about 90% of
                                                        businesses and more than 50% of employment
                                                        worldwide. The World Bank Group estimated that formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of
                                                        national income (GDP) in emerging

                                                    These numbers are significantly higher when informal SMEs are included. Furthermore, 600

                                                    for many governments around the
                                                    world. In emerging markets, most formal jobs are generated by SMEs, which create 7 out
                                                    of 10 jobs.
